Zero-yield bullion got an additional fillip from expectations that the U.S. interest rates may have peaked. Spot gold was up 3.2% at $1,928.15 per ounce by 0309 p.m. ET \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m1908 GMT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. U.S. gold futures settled 3.1% higher at $1,941.50. Prices were up 5.2% for the week. Investors kept a tab on developments in the Middle East conflict, which has unnerved markets since the start of the week. Israel said its infantry and tanks had carried out raids inside the Gaza Strip, its first announcement of a shift from an air war to ground operations to root out Hamas fighters a week after their deadly rampage in southern Israel. This fuelled inflows into assets considered to be safe havens such as gold. \"Investors are fleeing to safe havens as the risks of Middle East tensions grow,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. \"If the geopolitical situation gets gloomier, there is a good chance that gold prices could go to the $2,000 levels this year. We have come from mid-$1,800s to mid-$1,900s, $2,000 is just a fraction of that.\" U.S. consumer prices increased in September amid higher costs for rent and gasoline, but underlying inflation is slowing, data showed on Thursday. Apart from the conflict, \"despite yesterday\\'s warmer-than-expected \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mU.S.\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m inflation report, currently there is an expectation that the Fed will not hike rates in the November meeting, which is also helping \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mgold\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prices,\" said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. Traders currently see around a 69% chance of the Fed leaving interest rates unchanged this year, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Spot silver climbed 4% to $22.72 per ounce, on track for its first weekly gain in three. Platinum rose 1.4% to $880.42, while palladium dropped 0.3% to $1,141.24 and was set for a weekly decline.

Spot gold fell 0.3% to $1,868.79 per ounce by 3:04 p.m. ET \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m1904 GMT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, after hitting its highest level since Sept. 27 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures settled 0.2% lower at $1,883. The consumer price index increased 0.4% last month after a 0.3% gain in August, the Labour Department said. However, year-on-year consumer prices have come down from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. The warm CPI print might be enough to slow golds formidable rally into a consolidation but in itself shouldnt trigger a serious selloff, especially given high geopolitical tensions, said Tai Wong, a New York-based independent metals trader. Traders now see a 38% probability of a rate hike in December from the Fed, according to CME Fedwatch tool, compared with about a 28% chance seen before the report. U.S. benchmark 10-year yields and dollar index rose after the data. \u001b[0m\u001b[32m[\u001b[0m\u001b[32mUSD/\u001b[0m\u001b[32m]\u001b[0m\u001b[32m \u001b[0m\u001b[32m[\u001b[0m\u001b[32mUS/\u001b[0m\u001b[32m]\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. Offering support to safe-haven gold, the escalating conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant Islamist group Hamas has kept investors on the edge. Gold is used as a safe investment during times of political and financial uncertainty, but higher interest rates raise the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. There are still some signs that there is a slowdown in the U.S. economy, this should benefit gold. I anticipate prices could trade in the $1,860-$1,920 range in the near term, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Elsewhere, spot silver lost 1.2% to $21.79 per ounce, platinum fell 2.2% to $865.87, while palladium dipped 2.9% to $1,132.75.

Spot gold was up 0.5% at $1,882.59 per ounce by 1138 GMT, its highest level since Sept. 27. U.S. gold futures were up 0.4% at $1,895.40. Gold prices have appreciated on the back of a decline in yields, a more dovish tone from some Fed members and an element of safe-haven buying, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Bias remains for further modest gains towards $1,900 an ounce, with support at $1,840, he added. Minutes of the Feds September meeting showed growing uncertainty around the path of the U.S. economy pushed policymakers into a newly cautious stance last month, a position reaffirmed by top Fed officials in a series of statements this week. Helping non-yielding bullion, the dollar index and U.S. Treasury yields were subdued near two-week lows. Investors focus now shifts to the U.S. consumer price index \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mCPI\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m report due at 1230 GMT, which is expected to show inflation moderated last month. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in September, but underlying inflation pressures at the factory gate continued to abate. If CPI comes in hotter than expected, it may put the prospect of a November rate hike back on the table, added Hewson. High interest rates raise the opportunity cost of holding gold, which is still down more than 9% after moving above the key $2,000 per ounce level in May. Traders now see around a 72% chance of the Fed leaving interest rates unchanged this year, according to the CME Fedwatch tool.

Successive closed-door votes left Jordan with the backing of a majority of House Republicans, but still shy of the 217 votes he would need to win the job. Republicans then said they would go home for the weekend, ensuring the House would remain without a leader until at least Monday. Republican infighting has left the House paralyzed for close to two weeks, as lawmakers have deadlocked over a successor to Kevin McCarthy , who was forced out by a small group of Republicans on Oct. 3. In an initial vote, Jordan won the endorsement over Austin Scott, a Georgia lawmaker who has kept a relatively low profile in his 12 years in Congress. The vote was 124-81, according to a Republican aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. Jordan did not pick up much more support in a second round of voting, which he won 152-55, according to lawmakers, meaning that about one in four House Republicans cast a ballot purely against Jordan. That left him short of the votes he would need to become speaker, a powerful role second in line to the presidency after the vice president. Republicans control the chamber by a narrow 221-212 margin, meaning they can afford to lose no more than four votes if Democrats vote against him, as they are expected to do. Jordan narrowly lost the nomination on Wednesday to Steve Scalise , the No. 2 House Republican who was seen as the heir apparent to McCarthy. But Scalise abandoned his bid on Thursday after it became clear he could not consolidate Republicans behind him. Some Republicans said their problems ran deeper than a simple lack of leadership. \"Republicans have forgotten how to work as a team,\" Representative Dusty Johnson told reporters. \"I think it is a terribly corrosive trend.\" Jordan, 59, would be a departure from past Republican leaders like McCarthy, who have focused on raising money and balancing competing ideological groups. \u001b[0m\u001b[32m[\u001b[0m\u001b[32m1/6\u001b[0m\u001b[32m]\u001b[0m\u001b[32m House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep.

A close ally of Donald Trump, he helped amplify the former president\\'s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election and secured Trump\\'s endorsement last week. As chair of the Judiciary Committee, Jordan is helping to lead an impeachment investigation into Democratic President Joe Biden that Democrats characterize as baseless. \"I think I can unite the conference, I think I can tell the country what were doing and why it matters, Jordan told reporters before the vote. Democrats who have suggested working with Republicans on a consensus speaker pick said Jordan was not what they had in mind. \"House Republicans have selected as their nominee to be the speaker of the people\\'s House the chairman of the chaos caucus, a defender in a dangerous way of dysfunction and an extremist extraordinaire,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said. Without a speaker, the House is at a deadlock as war expands in the Middle East, Russia continues to pound Ukraine and the government faces a Nov. 17 partial shutdown deadline without additional funding from Congress. Republicans have been hoping to avoid a repeat of the embarrassing spectacle that occurred in January, when hardline conservatives forced McCarthy to endure 15 floor votes over four days before winning the gavel. Jordan backers said his confrontational style could help in negotiating with Biden and the Democratic-controlled Senate. \"We need someone who is tough, who\\'s smart and can negotiate in that room. I think Jim Jordan can do it,\" said Representative Nicole Malliotakis. But the second vote made clear that many Republicans were still reluctant to line up behind him. \"You\\'ve got a very, very thin margin and he\\'s going to have to basically get all of those no\\'s - including some people who swore up and down they never would support him,\" said Representative Kat Cammack. While McCarthy was the first speaker in U.S. history ousted by a vote of the chamber, the last two Republicans to hold the job - John Boehner and Paul Ryan - also left under pressure from their right flanks.

       "    \u001b[32m'WASHINGTON, Oct 13 \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mReuters\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m - Republican Jim Jordan, founder of a hardline U.S. House caucus that a former Republican speaker derided as \"legislative terrorists,\" on Friday was nominated by his party to take the top spot, testing whether a longtime critic can lead the restive caucus. Jordan, 59, was nominated for the role - second in line to the U.S. presidency after the vice president - after eight House Republicans, with the support of Democrats, voted his predecessor Kevin McCarthy out of leadership in a historic first and heir-apparent Steve Scalise dropped his bid. It became clear on Thursday that Scalise would not win the support of 217 of the 221 House Republicans, and it was not clear if Jordan would do better. Former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, backed Jordan just days after McCarthy\\'s ouster. Jordan was one of Trump\\'s most vocal defenders when he was impeached twice during his 2017-21 term. Jordan was first elected in 2006 to represent a deeply conservative rural district in northern Ohio and is a founder of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, a group that former Republican Speaker John Boehner labeled \"legislative terrorists.\" While McCarthy was the first House speaker formally voted out of leadership by his colleagues, his two Republican predecessors Boehner and Paul Ryan also resigned under pressure from their right flanks. Jordan\\'s elevation to speaker illustrates the narrow 221-212 Republican majority\\'s rightward shift over the past decade but could also test his ability to hold together a majority that can afford to lose just four votes on any measure that Democrats unite in opposition to. Before entering politics, Jordan honed his pugilistic style during a career as a high school and university champion wrestler, and later as a wrestling coach at Ohio State University. That past threatened his political career in 2018 when former students accused him of turning a blind eye to rampant sexual abuse of college wrestlers by the wrestling team\\'s doctor, when Jordan was an assistant coach. Jordan denied all allegations, and a university investigation found no hard evidence that he knew of the abuse. But former wrestlers insisted that the doctor\\'s abuse was well-known and the report itself found that students had complained about the doctor\\'s voyeurism in front of coaching staff. Jordan has often referred to his wrestling background in terms of his reputation as a fighter in Congress. He is known for his aggressive style of questioning in committee hearings, most recently as chair of the Judiciary Committee which has been investigating accusations of political interference at the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Acquire Licensing Rights \"I look at it like a wrestling match,\" Jordan told the New York Times in an April interview, explaining how he prepares for hearings. \"I\\'m going to try to get as ready as I can. You can\\'t just wing it.\" Jordan was an architect of the 2013 government shutdown over former President Barack Obama\\'s signature healthcare reforms, pushing again in 2018 for a shutdown over immigration reform. In 2015 he was part of a group who threatened then-Speaker Boehner with a motion to vacate - the same procedure that removed McCarthy from office. The motion was never brought to the House floor, but the threat and constant pressure from the far right wing of the Republican party eventually led Boehner to retire early. Boehner in a 2021 interview with CBS News said of Jordan: \"I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart.\" The Center for Effective Lawmaking, a research institute, has consistently rated Jordan as among the least effective lawmakers during his 16 years in Congress. Jordan also earned a reputation as one of Trump\\'s most loyal allies in Congress, particularly during the impeachment proceedings and in promoting Trump\\'s false claims that the 2020 election was marred by widespread fraud. Beginning in August 2020 he suggested that Democrats were attempting to defraud election results through mail-in ballots, gave multiple media interviews insisting that Trump had won the election, appeared at a Stop the Steal rally in Pennsylvania, and spoke on the House floor on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, to object to Arizona\\'s results of the election. Hours later thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. \"Jim Jordan knew more about what Donald Trump had planned for Jan. 6 than any other member of the House of Representatives,\" former Republican Representative Liz Cheney, chair of the now-defunct House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot, said in a speech last week. Jordan has denied his involvement. Jordan\\'s reputation as a firebrand haunted him in his run to serve as speaker, particularly with moderates who were concerned that his name would hurt their reelection campaigns in swing districts. \"The key is to unite the conference,\" Jordan told reporters in announcing his intention to run. \"I think I can do that.\" Reporting by Moira Warburton; Editing by Scott Malone and Grant McCool Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.'\u001b[0m,\n",

The House has been without a speaker since Oct. 3, when eight Republicans joined Democrats to oust Kevin McCarthy, the first time in U.S. history a speaker has been removed from the position. McCarthy\\'s removal raised concerns about the future of aid to Ukraine, since many of his possible successors have opposed more assistance to Kyiv, in addition to the $113 billion already approved since Russia invaded in February 2022. A majority of Republicans backed the hardline conservative Jordan in a closed-door meeting on Friday, but he appeared well shy of the 217 votes he would need to win the job in a final vote expected next week. Republicans have a narrow 221-212 majority in the House, and many join Democrats in backing Ukraine aid, but the next speaker could quash more assistance before a proposal reaches the House floor if he opposed the idea. Military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine is a priority of Democratic President Joe Biden\\'s administration. A Ukraine \"report card\" by Defending Democracy Together\\'s \"Republicans for Ukraine\" campaign gave Jordan an \"F very poor\" rating for his past votes against Ukraine aid. Jordan has told reporters he would not move forward with additional aid for Ukraine if elected speaker, saying, \"The most pressing issue in Americans\\' minds is not Ukraine. It is the border situation and crime on the streets.\" His office did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment. Opponents of the assistance call the funds excessive spending or accuse Kyiv of corruptly failing to keep track of the money, which U.S. and Ukrainian officials deny. McCarthy was ousted just three days after he led the House to pass a spending bill that included no new money for Ukraine, highlighting the reluctance of some of his caucus to back Ukraine funds.

The dollar dipped to nearly a two-week trough against a basket of currencies, tracking a slide in U.S. Treasury yields that have retreated from their 2007 highs scaled last week. The clear debate among Fed officials is for how long this terminal level of Fed funds rate is to be maintained before the first interest rate cut comes into play, said Kelvin Wong, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari on Tuesday said it is possible that the recent rise in longer-term Treasury yields means the U.S. central bank need not raise interest rates as much as otherwise, while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic sees no more rate hikes. Higher rates raise the opportunity cost of holding gold, which is priced in dollars and does not yield any interest. Gold prices rebounded from recent seven-month lows as Mid-East tensions fuelled safe-haven demand for bullion, but its next move depends on this weeks U.S. inflation data, pivotal to determining the Feds upcoming rate trajectory.

Gold is often a safe haven for investors during times of global instability. Wall Street\\'s main indexes opened higher , though caution prevailed amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

Israel pounded the Palestinian enclave of Gaza on Sunday, killing hundreds of people in retaliation for one of the bloodiest attacks in its history when gunmen from Hamas rampaged through Israeli towns on Saturday. Gold is used as a safe investment during times of political and financial uncertainty. Spot gold jumped almost 1% to $1,849.10 per ounce by 1132 GMT, having hit its highest level in a week. U.S. gold futures also climbed 1% to $1,863.40. With investors looking for safe haven assets, gold has benefited at least in the short-term from the spike in geopolitical tensions, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo. The spiralling violence between Israel and Hamas threatens to start a major new war in the Middle East, sending oil prices higher and boosting the demand for safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasuries, the dollar and the Japanese yen along with gold. That said, high US interest rates will remain a headwind for gold. We expect only higher gold prices once the Fed starts to sound more dovish over the course of 2024, added Staunovo. A hot inflation print later in the week could pave the way for another U.S. interest rate hike this year, dulling golds appeal. Investors are also focused on the minutes of the U.S. central banks September meeting due on Wednesday. The key question is how lasting these safe-haven flows are if this weekend has brought some tectonic shifts in the geopolitical landscape. At least from a commodity perspective, geopolitics tends to be a noise element rather than a lasting and impactful fundamental force, Julius Baer analyst Norbert Rcker said in a note.

Gold has regained its safe-haven status following the geopolitical events over the weekend, City Index Senior Analyst Matt Simpson said. We see the potential for gold to head for $1,880, but unless we see bond yields move materially lower, I doubt it can break $1,900 any time soon. The spiralling violence threatens to start a major new war in the Middle East, sending oil prices higher and boosting the demand for safe-haven assets like Treasuries, the dollar and the Japanese yen along with gold. Gold rebounded sharply from seven-month lows hit on Friday, but its upside remained capped by strong U.S. economic data that has bolstered the view that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to end its monetary policy tightening cycle in the near term. Last week, data showed that U.S. employment increased by the most in eight months in September, pointing to persistent labour market strength. A hot inflation print later in the week could pave the way for another U.S. interest rate hike this year. Higher U.S. rates raise the opportunity cost of holding gold, which yields no interest.

       "    \u001b[32m'The United States Supreme Court building is seen as in Washington, U.S., October 4, 2023. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights WASHINGTON, Oct 11 \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mReuters\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m - The U.S. Supreme Court\\'s conservative majority on Wednesday appeared poised to revive a Republican-drawn electoral map in South Carolina that was blocked by a lower court for racial bias after 30,000 Black residents were moved out of a congressional district . During arguments in a case that could help decide control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2024 elections, the conservative justices signaled sympathy toward arguments made by South Carolina officials defending the changes in composition of the district as driven by partisan benefit for Republicans. At issue was a map adopted last year by the Republican-led state legislature that redrew the boundaries of one of South Carolina\\'s seven U.S. House of Representatives districts - one that includes parts of Charleston along the Atlantic coast. A federal three-judge panel in January ruled that the map sorted voters along racial lines and diminished the clout of Black voters in violation of the U.S. Constitution\\'s 14th and 15th Amendments, which guarantee equal protection under the law and prohibit race-based voting discrimination. Black voters tend to favor Democratic candidates. A practice called gerrymandering involves the manipulation of electoral district boundaries to marginalize a certain set of voters and increase the influence of others. In this case, the state legislature was accused of racial gerrymandering to reduce the influence of Black voters in South Carolina\\'s 1st congressional district. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts expressed skepticism that the plaintiffs - Black voters who challenged the map - met their burden in the case, noting that they challenged the it \"without any direct evidence, with no alternative map, with no odd-shape districts which we often get in gerrymandering cases.\" Roberts added, \"Have we ever had a case before where all it is is circumstantial evidence?\" The Republican legislators and other state officials who appealed the lower court\\'s ruling argued that the map was designed to secure partisan advantages, a practice that the Supreme Court in 2019 decided was not reviewable by federal courts - unlike racial gerrymandering, which remains illegal. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wondered whether the challengers had overcome the presumption of good faith courts must give legislatures. \"Here, there\\'s no evidence that the legislature could have achieved its partisan tilt - which everyone says is permissible - in any other way,\" Gorsuch said. The new map increased the district\\'s share of white voters while reducing its share of Black voters, which the lower court referred to as \"bleaching.\" The Republicans faulted those judges for finding that the district\\'s composition was motivated primarily by race rather than Republican interests. Leah Aden, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund who argued on behalf of challengers to the map, said the evidentiary record \"reflects that there was a racial target, it reflects that there was a significant sorting of Black people, it reflects unrebutted expert evidence of race rather than party explaining the assignment of voters.\" The court\\'s liberal justices questioned the arguments made to defend the map. \"Your defense was, \\'We didn\\'t look at the racial data for this purpose.\\' And what the \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mlower\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m court said was, \\'I don\\'t believe that,\\'\" liberal Justice Elena Kagan told a lawyer arguing for South Carolina. The eventual ruling by the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, may determine whether Democrats have a realistic shot to win the 1st district, currently represented by Republican Nancy Mace. The map shifted 30,000 Black residents into the neighboring 6th congressional district that stretches 125 miles \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m200 km\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m inland from Charleston. These voters were unlawfully \"exiled,\" the three-judge panel wrote. The 6th district has been held for three decades by Democrat Jim Clyburn, one of the most prominent Black members of Congress. Clyburn\\'s is the only one of South Carolina\\'s House districts held by a Democrat. Legislative districts across the United States are redrawn to reflect population changes documented in the nationwide census conducted every decade. With the district\\'s previous boundaries in place, Mace only narrowly defeated an incumbent Democrat in 2020 - by just over 1 percentage point, or 5,400 votes. With the redistricting, Mace won re-election in 2022 by 14 percentage points. The parties in the case have asked the Supreme Court to decide the case by the end of the year to enable the map to be finalized ahead of the Nov. 5, 2024, congressional elections. Similar legal battles over electoral maps in other states could influence which party ends up controlling the House. The Supreme Court in June ruled against Alabama Republicans in one such case, ordering that state to devise a second majority-Black U.S. House district in a ruling that gave a boost to Democrats.

Republicans can afford only a handful of defections as they control the chamber by a narrow 221-212 majority and Democrats are not expected to vote for any Republican candidate. \"We\\'re working hard to get unified. We need to get unified because the world is not waiting,\" Scalise, 58, told reporters. \"Obviously we still have work to do.\" Acting Speaker Patrick McHenry told reporters a vote \"could be as early as today.\" \"It\\'s not over yet. That was the inside race. Now the outside race starts,\" said Representative Thomas Massie, who had voted for Jordan. Massie and said he expected to meet privately with Scalise ahead of a floor vote.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein Acquire Licensing Rights Jordan plans to vote for Scalise on the floor and is encouraging his colleagues to do the same, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. McCarthy in January had to endure 15 rounds of voting before clinching the speakership. Before selecting Scalise, Republicans rejected a proposal that would have required their nominee to secure 217 of their 221 votes. That allowed Scalise to win the nomination quickly, but left open the question of whether he would face a repeat of the battle in January for the role of speaker, which played out over four days. Republican Representative Kat Cammack predicted the floor vote would be a \"bloodbath ... a continuation of the chaos that has plagued the House.\" Republicans say they need to quickly resolve a leadership vacuum that has prevented the House from addressing the war in Israel , approving more aid to Ukraine and passing spending bills before current government funding runs out on Nov. 17. Scalise said his first action as speaker would be to schedule a vote on a resolution making clear that the United States stands with Israel in its war with Hamas militants in Gaza. It took only eight Republicans to oust McCarthy last week, a fact that could make leading the caucus a challenge for any new speaker. While McCarthy was the first speaker in U.S. history to be removed in a formal vote, the last two Republicans to hold the job wound up leaving under pressure from party hardliners. Americans have little confidence in Congress\\' ability to overcome its partisan differences - and the Republican infighting that led to McCarthy\\'s ouster on Oct. 3. Some 64% of respondents to a Reuters/Ipsos poll last week said they did not believe Washington politicians could put aside partisan disagreements for the good of the nation.

The move comes a day after federal prosecutors filed 23 fresh criminal counts against the first-term U.S. representative, accusing him of inflating his campaign\\'s fundraising numbers and charging campaign contributors\\' credit cards without their consent. Santos, who represents a district including parts of New York City and its eastern suburbs, has been enmeshed in scandal since his November 2022 election, first facing accusations that he fabricated much of his resume and then criminal indictment. But with a narrow 221-212 majority, the House\\'s Republican leadership has not taken action. Santos pleaded not guilty to an initial May indictment and has said he will do the same for the new one. The charges against Santos include false statements, aggravated identity theft and credit card fraud, accusing him of using the credit card information of people who had already donated to his campaign to make additional contributions. \"He has no business being in the halls of the House of Representatives. He\\'s an immoral person, he\\'s an untrustworthy person, he\\'s scammed hundreds of thousands of voters,\" Representative Nick LaLota, a Republican who also represents a New York suburb, told reporters on Wednesday. A motion to expel would require support from two-thirds of members in the House, meaning 290 votes. Democrats have repeatedly called for Santos to be expelled, and over a dozen Republicans have done the same. \"If they want to be judge, jury and arbitrator of the whole goddamn thing, let them do it,\" Santos said on Wednesday. LaLota said the group did not yet have support from the required two-thirds of the House, but predicted the resolution would \"catch fire.\" It is unclear when the motion would get a vote on the House floor, given that Republicans are currently trying to elect a new nominee for speaker after eight Republicans sided with all Democrats to oust Kevin McCarthy in a historic first last week.

If the jobs data comes stronger than expected, then market expectation of one more hike will rise, and with that gold prices could dip below $1,800, added Melek.

Spot gold edged up 0.1% to $1,822.79 per ounce by 1201 GMT. U.S. gold futures gained 0.1% to $1,836.70 per ounce. Gold on Wednesday posted its worst losing run since 2016, dropping for an eighth straight session, as the likelihood of U.S. interest rates staying higher for longer weighed on sentiment. Echoing investor demand, SPDR Gold Trust, the worlds largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell to their lowest since August 2019 on Wednesday. Over the past few weeks gold really took a tumble, the big driver for that appears to be the rise in long-term U.S. interest rates, said Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics. The benchmark 10-year bond yield slipped after data on Wednesday showed U.S. private payrolls increased far less than expected in September. Septembers non-farm payrolls report on Friday is expected to show that employers added 170,000 jobs. Traders are pricing in around a 37% chance of another rate hike from the Fed this year, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates as these increase the opportunity cost of holding it. As we get towards the end of this year, we do think that the price of gold will appreciate next year and in our view that the Fed will cut interest rates by more than markets currently anticipate, Gardner said. Spot silver rose 0.6% to $21.09 per ounce, having slipped to its lowest since mid-March this week. Platinum fell 0.5% to $861.92 after hitting its lowest in a year in the last session.

Data on Thursday showed U.S. private payrolls increased far less than expected in September. Markets now await the Labor Departments more comprehensive employment report on Friday. A broad selloff in world government bonds on Wednesday drove up U.S. 30-year Treasury yields to 5% for the first time since 2007. The benchmark 10-year bond yield fell from 16-year highs on Thursday and the U.S. dollar was 0.1% lower, easing some pressure on non-yielding gold. SPDR Gold Trust, the worlds largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell to its lowest since August 2019. Spot gold may test a resistance at $1,834 per ounce, a break above which could lead to a gain to $1,855, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. The subdued dollar also buoyed other greenback-priced precious metals, with spot silver 0.5% to $21.07 per ounce, having slipped to its lowest since mid-March this week.

Spot gold was up 0.2% at $1,825.99 per ounce by 1238 GMT, while U.S. gold futures were steady at $1,841.20. The dollar slipped 0.3%, making gold less expensive for other currency holders. Data on Tuesday showed U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in August, pointing to a still-tight labour market that could lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. However, U.S. private payrolls increased far less than expected in September, data showed on Wednesday, leaving investors waiting for the main non-farm payrolls report on Friday for more clues to the Feds rate hike path. The benchmark U.S. 10-year bond yield scaled fresh 16-year highs, while sentiment in wider financial markets also remained weak as the bond rout continues. The price of gold has fallen more than $100 in the past two weeks as bets for higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates dented the zero-yielding assets appeal and partly overshadowed its traditional safe-haven role. A fall below $1,800 is likely, if the narrative that the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer continues to gain traction, said ActivTrades senior analyst Ricardo Evangelista.

Some Republicans, including Representative Jim Jordan, a top candidate for the job, also want lawmakers to agree on how to move forward on the thorniest issue the House faces federal spending for the current year when they choose a new speaker. The U.S. in 2016 pledged $3.8 billion in annual aid to Israel under former President Barack Obama, part of a record 10-year $38 billion aid deal that guarantees weapons, ammo and other military support. House Republicans are expected to hear from speaker candidates behind closed doors on Tuesday and vote to choose their nominee on Wednesday. A House floor vote to elect a replacement for Republican former Speaker Kevin McCarthy could come later in the week. Until then, the chamber cannot approve new aid. \"It\\'s not ideal,\" Republican Representative Michael McCaul told CNN on Sunday. \"What kind of message are we sending to our adversaries when we can\\'t govern, when we\\'re dysfunctional, when we don\\'t even have a speaker of the House?\" Jordan and others also want a spending agreement, which could avert a government shutdown next month. \"When we walk out of that room we\\'ve got to have 218 votes for a Republican speaker and we\\'ve got to have 218 votes for how we deal with Nov. 17, when the funding bill for the government comes due,\" Jordan, who is battling the House\\'s No.2 Republican Steve Scalise of Louisiana for speakership, told Fox News on Sunday. Hardliners pushing for cuts that would reduce government funding to fiscal 2022 levels have divided House Republicans for months and brought Congress to the brink of a government shutdown just over a week ago. Any House bill that includes severe spending cuts is unlikely to pass the Democrat-controlled Senate. \"I am not going to support anybody until the conference figures out spending,\" Republican Representative Ken Buck told ABC\\'s \"This Week\" on Sunday. Securing the 218 votes to elect a new speaker behind closed doors would avoid a recurrence of the 15 floor votes that preceded McCarthy\\'s election to the speakership in January. Matt Gaetz, the Florida congressman who led McCarthys ouster, downplayed the speaker election\\'s impact on Israel\\'s security needs, suggesting on NBCs \"Meet the Press\" that the U.S. could fulfill the country\\'s requests. U.S. President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday that \"additional assistance for the Israeli Defense Forces is now on its way to Israel,\" and that more would follow in the coming days, the White House said. \"The actions taken by some members of my party were wholly irresponsible without this going on,\" Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie told ABC\\'s \"This Week\". \"They\\'re now even putting a brighter light on the irresponsibility of not having someone in place.\" Reporting by Joey Roulette and David Morgan; Editing by Heather Timmons and Lisa Shumaker Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.'\u001b[0m,\n",

His unusual trip to Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia underscores the criticism that he and other Democratic city and state leaders have voiced for the immigration policies of their fellow Democrat, President Joe Biden. \"Our hearts are endless, but our resources are not,\" Adams said at a press conference during a stop in Puebla in central Mexico. \"They deserve a more dignified environment than we are able to give.\" That New York City\\'s mayor has traveled thousands of miles to make his case highlights how the latest wave of migrants is reshaping the immigration debate among some Democratic leaders. Republican governors near the border have been fiercely critical of Biden\\'s border policies. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has been busing thousands of migrants north to New York, Chicago and other Democratic-controlled cities. But in recent months, Adams and some other Democrats have said their cities far from the southern border are now also being strained by a surge of new arrivals, many of whom are fleeing violence and economic distress in Venezuela. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, called the influx \"untenable\" in a letter to Biden on Monday, while the mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, also a Democrat, said this week he planned to visit the U.S.-Mexico border after more than 17,000 migrants had arrived in the city since last year. Immigration will likely be a campaign theme in the U.S. 2024 presidential race with a 54% majority of Americans agreeing with the statement that \"immigration is making life harder for native-born Americans,\" a September Reuters/Ipsos poll found. Some 73% of Republicans and 37% of Democrats surveyed agreed with that statement. \u001b[0m\u001b[32m[\u001b[0m\u001b[32m1/2\u001b[0m\u001b[32m]\u001b[0m\u001b[32m New York City Mayor Eric Adams delivers a speech during a meeting with migrants, community leaders, and mayors from the Mixteca region, in Puebla, Mexico October 5, 2023. REUTERS/Imelda Medina/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights Biden\\'s administration said on Thursday it will add sections to a wall to reduce the record number of migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, carrying forward a signature policy of former President Donald Trump, Biden\\'s predecessor and the frontrunner in the Republican race to challenge him in 2024. Adams has said that many asylum seekers set out for New York in the belief they would receive jobs and rooms in \"five-star hotels\" upon arrival, led astray by misinformation spread by smugglers and on social media. \"We\\'re saying that is not true.\" The New York Immigration Coalition and other advocacy groups have criticized Adams\\' trip as an ineffectual use of time and money when Adams is slashing city budgets, saying New York\\'s mayor has no influence on international policy and that the city has mismanaged the existing shelter system. They have said his remarks last month that the migrant crisis will \"destroy New York City\" are inflammatory. This week, Adams\\' office asked a judge to end a decades-old right-to-shelter mandate, which requires New York to provide a place to sleep to anyone who needs one. The city says hundreds of migrants are arriving each day with nowhere to stay. The effort is opposed by the Legal Aid Society, which advocates for newly arrived migrants seeking shelter. Joshua Goldfein, a Legal Aid attorney, said it was unclear whether physically traveling to the Darien Gap might help with the crisis in New York City, and there was more the mayor could be doing without leaving his hometown. Much of the misinformation the mayor has described was being seen by asylum seekers on cellphones, in TikTok videos being shared on WhatsApp. To counter this, the city should be making its own videos in the languages of the migrants traveling north, Goldfein said. \"All three levels of government need to step up here to solve this problem,\" Goldfein said: the federal government should be giving people work authorization, and assisting local officials in states and cities to meet new arrivals and help them resettle in less expensive and strained cities. \"But they\\'re all sort of pointing fingers at each other.\" Adams will tour migrant shelters in Ecuador on Friday, and on Saturday he will visit the Darien Gap, a roadless jungle region straddling the Colombia-Panama border that requires several days of dangerous hiking to cross, although it is unclear how far in the mayor will go.

Newsom\\'s veto is a big setback for activists who had been advocating for the legislation. U.S. discrimination laws ban ancestry discrimination though they do not explicitly mention a prohibition on casteism. California\\'s legislation targeted the caste system in South Asian and Hindu immigrant communities by adding caste as a protected class to the state\\'s existing anti-discrimination laws. The bill was introduced and authored by Democratic state Senator Aisha Wahab , an Afghan American, in March. An earlier version of it passed the state Senate before undergoing revisions. The revised version, which listed caste under \"ancestry\" and not as a separate category, was passed by California\\'s state Assembly in late August and by the state Senate in early September with a near unanimous vote. The bill defined caste as \"an individual\\'s perceived position in a system of social stratification on the basis of inherited status.\" \"Because discrimination based on caste is already prohibited under these existing categories, this bill is unnecessary,\" Newsom said in a letter to California state lawmakers posted on the website of the governor\\'s office. \"For this reason, I cannot sign this bill.\" Activists opposing caste discrimination said it is no different from other forms of discrimination like racism and hence should be outlawed. Opponents of the bill in California said that since U.S. laws already ban ancestry discrimination, a legislation of this type becomes meaningless and only serves to stigmatize the entire community, mostly Hindus and South Asians, with a broad brush. Prior to Newsom\\'s veto, the movement to fight caste discrimination in North America had picked up energy in recent months. Earlier this year, Seattle became the first U.S. city to outlaw caste discrimination after a city council vote and Toronto\\'s school board became the first in Canada to recognize that caste discrimination existed in the city\\'s schools. In California itself, last month, Fresno became only the second U.S. city to ban caste discrimination after a unanimous city council vote. The issue is particularly important to Americans of Indian descent and Hindus. As more Indians and South Asians have moved to the U.S., particularly to California and Silicon Valley, some of America\\'s biggest technology companies have also had to confront the issue of caste discrimination. Many U.S. tech firms are also headed by leaders of Indian origin such as Alphabet \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mGOOGL.O\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mMSFT.O\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m CEO Satya Nadella and IBM \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mIBM.N\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m CEO Arvind Krishna. The caste system is among the world\\'s oldest forms of rigid social stratification. It dates back thousands of years and allows many privileges to upper castes but represses lower castes. The Dalit community is on the lowest rung of the Hindu caste system; members have been treated as \"untouchables.\" India outlawed caste discrimination over 70 years ago, yet several studies in recent years show that bias persists. One study found people from lower castes were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs. Dalits still face widespread abuse across India, where their attempts at upward social mobility have at times been violently put down. Debate over the caste system in India and abroad is contentious and intertwined with religion. Some people say discrimination is now rare, especially outside India. Indian government policies reserving seats for lower-caste students at top Indian universities have helped many land tech jobs in the West in recent years. \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mThis story has been refiled to correct the spelling of \\'existing\\' in paragraph 1\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Washington; editing by Grant McCool Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Spot gold eased 0.2% to $1,819 per ounce by 0723 GMT, while U.S. gold futures dropped 0.3% to $1,835.50. Prices fell for a seventh consecutive session on Tuesday to touch their lowest level since March at $1,813.90, as the U.S. dollar strengthened on data showing U.S. job openings unexpectedly increased in August. The continuous selloff in U.S. Treasuries is keeping gold under pressure but since most of the moves have been priced in, there should not be any further corrections in bullion prices, said Kunal Shah, head of research at Nirmal Bang Commodities in Mumbai.

The last legs are very painful and that is what we are witnessing now. The benchmark U.S. 10-year bond yield scaled fresh 16-year highs, diminishing demand for non-interest-paying bullion. Fed officials consider the rising long-term Treasury yields as evidence their tight-money policies are working. The elevated dollar also pressured other greenback-priced precious metals, with spot silver down 0.6% at $21.03 per ounce, having slipped to its lowest since mid-March in the previous session. Platinum slid 0.9% to $863.48, its lowest in a year. Palladium dropped 2.2% to $1,163.55 and hit its lowest since November 2018. This is a broad-based impact coming from the rapid rise in rates, said Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery. The interpretation within the more industrially led metals relates to concerns that higher rates will damage demand.

U.S. gold futures settled 0.3% lower at $1,841.50 per ounce. U.S. job openings unexpectedly increased in August, pointing to tight labour market conditions that could compel the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. \"The JOLTS report has surprised the market as it raises prospects of another hike but also lowers expectation of a slowdown in the U.S. economy, pressuring precious metals,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Gold is considered a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties. But higher interest rates raise the opportunity cost of holding bullion, which is priced in dollars and does not yield interest. Gold prices briefly ticked up earlier in the session as the dollar sharply weakened against the yen, just moments after briefly rising above 150 for the first time since October 2022, signalling a possible intervention by the Bank of Japan. \"If the Bank of Japan intervenes, it could weaken dollar in the short term and provide some support to the precious metals,\" Moya added. The market focus is now on September nonfarm payrolls data due on Friday. \"We reiterate our 12-month target of $1,725 per ounce and remain cautious on gold,\" said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke.

Federal Governor Michelle Bowman said she remains willing to support another increase in rates if incoming data shows progress on inflation is stalling or proceeding too slowly. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, however, said rates are \"at or near\" sufficiently restrictive level. Since powering above the key $2,000-per-ounce level in early May, gold prices have fallen more than 11%, or $230, pressured by a sharp rise in benchmark U.S. Treasury yields, which makes the non-yielding gold less attractive. \"The buying on dips \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32min gold\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m by central banks is now conspicuously absent,\" said Tai Wong, a New York-based independent metals trader.

The three-judge panel selected a map that preserves the state\\'s lone majority-Black district while creating a second district in which Black voters make up nearly half of the voting-age population. The decision came after the court found - for the second time - that congressional lines drawn by the Republican-dominated state legislature likely violated the Voting Rights Act by illegally diluting Black votes. Democrats would need to flip five seats in the 435-seat House of Representatives to take back the majority in the November 2024 election. More than a quarter of Alabama\\'s residents are Black, but the Republican-backed plans only included a single district in which Black voters made up a majority or close to it. That district, the 7th, is represented by the state\\'s lone Democrat, Terri Sewell, a Black woman. Civil rights groups challenged the Republican map, arguing that Republicans had deliberately spread Black voters thin to ensure they would continue to win six of the state\\'s seven districts. The U.S. Supreme Court twice declined to overturn the panel\\'s conclusions that the Republican plans were unlawful. \"It did not have to be this way,\" the panel wrote in its decision on Thursday. \"And it would not have been this way if the legislature had created a second opportunity district or majority-minority district.\" Similar challenges are also pending in Louisiana and Georgia, where civil rights groups have argued that Republican lawmakers illegally disadvantaged Black voters by manipulating congressional lines. The new Alabama map was one of three that a court-appointed special master drew for its consideration. The panel included two judges appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump. The third was appointed by Republican former President Ronald Reagan and then elevated to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by Democratic former President Bill Clinton.

Lindell, a prominent supporter of Republican former president and current GOP candidate Donald Trump, is fighting claims that he spread false conspiracy theories that Dominion and Smartmatic voting machines were used to rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election for Democrat Joe Biden. Lindell has not made any payments on his legal bills since July, his lawyers at Parker Daniels Kibort and Lewin & Lewin told federal judges in Minnesota and Washington, D.C. overseeing the defamation cases. Forcing the firm to continue representing Lindell without payment \"could threaten the very existence of the firm,\" Parker Daniels Kibort co-founder Andrew Parker said in a court filing. Parker did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lindell said on Thursday that he is \"out of money\" and praised his lawyers as being courageous. Lindell said he was the victim of \"lawfare\" and that he is unable to borrow money. He said he is looking for new counsel. \"Well find someone, thats the way it is,\" Lindell said.

Spot gold rose 0.4% to $1,872.79 per ounce by 0820 GMT, but was set to decline 3.5% in September - its worst month in seven. Prices are down 2.5% for the quarter. U.S. gold futures gained 0.6% to $1,889.50. The dollar pulled back from 10-month highs and benchmark 10-year Treasury yields also retreated from a 16-year peak, lifting bullions appeal, but both were still headed for their best quarters in four. The gold market has taken on board the Federal Reserves messaging around a longer plateau on rates, said Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery. Definitely, the longer part is the most important element of higher-for-longer. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Thursday its unclear whether more monetary policy changes will be needed in the coming months. Higher rates raise the opportunity cost of holding bullion, which is priced in dollars and does not yield any interest.

      "Gold prices jumped more than 3% on Friday and were poised for their best week in seven months as the intensifying conflict in the Middle East sent investors scurrying for safe-haven assets. Zero-yield bullion got an additional fillip from expectations that the U.S. interest rates may have peaked. Spot gold was up 3.2% at $1,928.15 per ounce by 0309 p.m. ET (1908 GMT). U.S. gold futures settled 3.1% higher at $1,941.50. Prices were up 5.2% for the week. Investors kept a tab on developments in the Middle East conflict, which has unnerved markets since the start of the week. Israel said its infantry and tanks had carried out raids inside the Gaza Strip, its first announcement of a shift from an air war to ground operations to root out Hamas fighters a week after their deadly rampage in southern Israel. This fuelled inflows into assets considered to be safe havens such as gold. \"Investors are fleeing to safe havens as the risks of Middle East tensions grow,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. \"If the geopolitical situation gets gloomier, there is a good chance that gold prices could go to the $2,000 levels this year. We have come from mid-$1,800s to mid-$1,900s, $2,000 is just a fraction of that.\" U.S. consumer prices increased in September amid higher costs for rent and gasoline, but underlying inflation is slowing, data showed on Thursday. Apart from the conflict, \"despite yesterday's warmer-than-expected (U.S.) inflation report, currently there is an expectation that the Fed will not hike rates in the November meeting, which is also helping (gold) prices,\" said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. Traders currently see around a 69% chance of the Fed leaving interest rates unchanged this year, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Spot silver climbed 4% to $22.72 per ounce, on track for its first weekly gain in three. Platinum rose 1.4% to $880.42, while palladium dropped 0.3% to $1,141.24 and was set for a weekly decline. Israel has launched an air strike against Syria's Aleppo Airport late on Saturday that put it out of service, the Syrian defence ministry said. Morocco's government will resume subsidy cuts when conditions in the international market permit, the minister in charge of the budget said. \n",
      "Gold prices eased on Thursday as dollar and Treasury yields ticked higher after U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in September and raised worries that the Federal Reserve could keep rates higher for some time. Spot gold fell 0.3% to $1,868.79 per ounce by 3:04 p.m. ET (1904 GMT), after hitting its highest level since Sept. 27 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures settled 0.2% lower at $1,883. The consumer price index increased 0.4% last month after a 0.3% gain in August, the Labour Department said. However, year-on-year consumer prices have come down from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. The warm CPI print might be enough to slow golds formidable rally into a consolidation but in itself shouldnt trigger a serious selloff, especially given high geopolitical tensions, said Tai Wong, a New York-based independent metals trader. Traders now see a 38% probability of a rate hike in December from the Fed, according to CME Fedwatch tool, compared with about a 28% chance seen before the report.

Gold prices have appreciated on the back of a decline in yields, a more dovish tone from some Fed members and an element of safe-haven buying, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Bias remains for further modest gains towards $1,900 an ounce, with support at $1,840, he added. Minutes of the Feds September meeting showed growing uncertainty around the path of the U.S. economy pushed policymakers into a newly cautious stance last month, a position reaffirmed by top Fed officials in a series of statements this week.

Investors focus now shifts to the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report due at 1230 GMT, which is expected to show inflation moderated last month. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in September, but underlying inflation pressures at the factory gate continued to abate. If CPI comes in hotter than expected, it may put the prospect of a November rate hike back on the table, added Hewson. High interest rates raise the opportunity cost of holding gold, which is still down more than 9% after moving above the key $2,000 per ounce level in May.

      "Representative Jim Jordan won the Republican nomination to lead the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday, but the hardline conservative appeared to be well short of the support he would need to seize the speaker's gavel. Successive closed-door votes left Jordan with the backing of a majority of House Republicans, but still shy of the 217 votes he would need to win the job. Republicans then said they would go home for the weekend, ensuring the House would remain without a leader until at least Monday. Republican infighting has left the House paralyzed for close to two weeks, as lawmakers have deadlocked over a successor to Kevin McCarthy , who was forced out by a small group of Republicans on Oct. 3. In an initial vote, Jordan won the endorsement over Austin Scott, a Georgia lawmaker who has kept a relatively low profile in his 12 years in Congress. The vote was 124-81, according to a Republican aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. Jordan did not pick up much more support in a second round of voting, which he won 152-55, according to lawmakers, meaning that about one in four House Republicans cast a ballot purely against Jordan. That left him short of the votes he would need to become speaker, a powerful role second in line to the presidency after the vice president. Republicans control the chamber by a narrow 221-212 margin, meaning they can afford to lose no more than four votes if Democrats vote against him, as they are expected to do. Jordan narrowly lost the nomination on Wednesday to Steve Scalise , the No. 2 House Republican who was seen as the heir apparent to McCarthy. But Scalise abandoned his bid on Thursday after it became clear he could not consolidate Republicans behind him. Some Republicans said their problems ran deeper than a simple lack of leadership. \"Republicans have forgotten how to work as a team,\" Representative Dusty Johnson told reporters. \"I think it is a terribly corrosive trend.\" Jordan, 59, would be a departure from past Republican leaders like McCarthy, who have focused on raising money and balancing competing ideological groups. [1/6] House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), a prime contender in the race to be the next Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, arrives for a House Republican Conference meeting as Republicans work to restart their effort to pick a new leader for the U.S. House of... Acquire Licensing Rights Read more He has been a vocal presence on the party's right wing and tormentor of party leaders since he was first elected in 2006. A close ally of Donald Trump, he helped amplify the former president's false claims of fraud in the 2020 election and secured Trump's endorsement last week. As chair of the Judiciary Committee, Jordan is helping to lead an impeachment investigation into Democratic President Joe Biden that Democrats characterize as baseless. \"I think I can unite the conference, I think I can tell the country what were doing and why it matters, Jordan told reporters before the vote. Democrats who have suggested working with Republicans on a consensus speaker pick said Jordan was not what they had in mind. \"House Republicans have selected as their nominee to be the speaker of the people's House the chairman of the chaos caucus, a defender in a dangerous way of dysfunction and an extremist extraordinaire,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said. Without a speaker, the House is at a deadlock as war expands in the Middle East, Russia continues to pound Ukraine and the government faces a Nov. 17 partial shutdown deadline without additional funding from Congress. Republicans have been hoping to avoid a repeat of the embarrassing spectacle that occurred in January, when hardline conservatives forced McCarthy to endure 15 floor votes over four days before winning the gavel. Jordan backers said his confrontational style could help in negotiating with Biden and the Democratic-controlled Senate. \"We need someone who is tough, who's smart and can negotiate in that room. I think Jim Jordan can do it,\" said Representative Nicole Malliotakis. But the second vote made clear that many Republicans were still reluctant to line up behind him. \"You've got a very, very thin margin and he's going to have to basically get all of those no's - including some people who swore up and down they never would support him,\" said Representative Kat Cammack. While McCarthy was the first speaker in U.S. history ousted by a vote of the chamber, the last two Republicans to hold the job - John Boehner and Paul Ryan - also left under pressure from their right flanks. \n",
      "Republican Jim Jordan, founder of a hardline U.S. House caucus that a former Republican speaker derided as \"legislative terrorists,\" on Friday was nominated by his party to take the top spot, testing whether a longtime critic can lead the restive caucus. Jordan, 59, was nominated for the role - second in line to the U.S. presidency after the vice president - after eight House Republicans, with the support of Democrats, voted his predecessor Kevin McCarthy out of leadership in a historic first and heir-apparent Steve Scalise dropped his bid. It became clear on Thursday that Scalise would not win the support of 217 of the 221 House Republicans, and it was not clear if Jordan would do better. Former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, backed Jordan just days after McCarthy's ouster. Jordan was one of Trump's most vocal defenders when he was impeached twice during his 2017-21 term. Jordan was first elected in 2006 to represent a deeply conservative rural district in northern Ohio and is a founder of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, a group that former Republican Speaker John Boehner labeled \"legislative terrorists.\" While McCarthy was the first House speaker formally voted out of leadership by his colleagues, his two Republican predecessors Boehner and Paul Ryan also resigned under pressure from their right flanks. Jordan's elevation to speaker illustrates the narrow 221-212 Republican majority's rightward shift over the past decade but could also test his ability to hold together a majority that can afford to lose just four votes on any measure that Democrats unite in opposition to. Before entering politics, Jordan honed his pugilistic style during a career as a high school and university champion wrestler, and later as a wrestling coach at Ohio State University. That past threatened his political career in 2018 when former students accused him of turning a blind eye to rampant sexual abuse of college wrestlers by the wrestling team's doctor, when Jordan was an assistant coach. Jordan denied all allegations, and a university investigation found no hard evidence that he knew of the abuse. But former wrestlers insisted that the doctor's abuse was well-known and the report itself found that students had complained about the doctor's voyeurism in front of coaching staff. Jordan has often referred to his wrestling background in terms of his reputation as a fighter in Congress. He is known for his aggressive style of questioning in committee hearings, most recently as chair of the Judiciary Committee which has been investigating accusations of political interference at the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH) speaks during a House Oversight and Accountability Committee impeachment inquiry hearing into U.S. President Joe Biden, focused on his son Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 28, 2023. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Acquire Licensing Rights \"I look at it like a wrestling match,\" Jordan told the New York Times in an April interview, explaining how he prepares for hearings. \"I'm going to try to get as ready as I can. You can't just wing it.\" Jordan was an architect of the 2013 government shutdown over former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reforms, pushing again in 2018 for a shutdown over immigration reform. In 2015 he was part of a group who threatened then-Speaker Boehner with a motion to vacate - the same procedure that removed McCarthy from office. The motion was never brought to the House floor, but the threat and constant pressure from the far right wing of the Republican party eventually led Boehner to retire early. Boehner in a 2021 interview with CBS News said of Jordan: \"I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart.\" The Center for Effective Lawmaking, a research institute, has consistently rated Jordan as among the least effective lawmakers during his 16 years in Congress. Jordan also earned a reputation as one of Trump's most loyal allies in Congress, particularly during the impeachment proceedings and in promoting Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was marred by widespread fraud. Beginning in August 2020 he suggested that Democrats were attempting to defraud election results through mail-in ballots, gave multiple media interviews insisting that Trump had won the election, appeared at a Stop the Steal rally in Pennsylvania, and spoke on the House floor on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, to object to Arizona's results of the election. Hours later thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. \"Jim Jordan knew more about what Donald Trump had planned for Jan. 6 than any other member of the House of Representatives,\" former Republican Representative Liz Cheney, chair of the now-defunct House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot, said in a speech last week. Jordan has denied his involvement. Jordan's reputation as a firebrand haunted him in his run to serve as speaker, particularly with moderates who were concerned that his name would hurt their reelection campaigns in swing districts. \"The key is to unite the conference,\" Jordan told reporters in announcing his intention to run. \"I think I can do that.\" \n",
      "U.S. Representative Jim Jordan, who won the Republican nomination to lead the House of Representatives on Friday, has voted against most aid to Ukraine as it fights a Russian invasion and told reporters he would object to further aid if he became speaker. The House has been without a speaker since Oct. 3, when eight Republicans joined Democrats to oust Kevin McCarthy, the first time in U.S. history a speaker has been removed from the position. McCarthy's removal raised concerns about the future of aid to Ukraine, since many of his possible successors have opposed more assistance to Kyiv, in addition to the $113 billion already approved since Russia invaded in February 2022. A majority of Republicans backed the hardline conservative Jordan in a closed-door meeting on Friday, but he appeared well shy of the 217 votes he would need to win the job in a final vote expected next week. Republicans have a narrow 221-212 majority in the House, and many join Democrats in backing Ukraine aid, but the next speaker could quash more assistance before a proposal reaches the House floor if he opposed the idea. Military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine is a priority of Democratic President Joe Biden's administration. A Ukraine \"report card\" by Defending Democracy Together's \"Republicans for Ukraine\" campaign gave Jordan an \"F very poor\" rating for his past votes against Ukraine aid. Jordan has told reporters he would not move forward with additional aid for Ukraine if elected speaker, saying, \"The most pressing issue in Americans' minds is not Ukraine. It is the border situation and crime on the streets.\" His office did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment. Opponents of the assistance call the funds excessive spending or accuse Kyiv of corruptly failing to keep track of the money, which U.S. and Ukrainian officials deny. McCarthy was ousted just three days after he led the House to pass a spending bill that included no new money for Ukraine, highlighting the reluctance of some of his caucus to back Ukraine funds. \n",
      "Gold prices firmed near a more than one-week high on Wednesday as the dollar edged lower after several U.S. Federal Reserve officials suggested that the recent surge in Treasury yields might make further rate hikes less necessary. Spot gold was 0.1% higher at $1,862.69 per ounce as of 0718 GMT after hitting its highest level since Sept. 29 on Tuesday. U.S. gold futures held their ground at $1,876. The dollar dipped to nearly a two-week trough against a basket of currencies, tracking a slide in U.S. Treasury yields that have retreated from their 2007 highs scaled last week. The clear debate among Fed officials is for how long this terminal level of Fed funds rate is to be maintained before the first interest rate cut comes into play, said Kelvin Wong, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari on Tuesday said it is possible that the recent rise in longer-term Treasury yields means the U.S. central bank need not raise interest rates as much as otherwise, while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic sees no more rate hikes. Higher rates raise the opportunity cost of holding gold, which is priced in dollars and does not yield any interest. Gold prices rebounded from recent seven-month lows as Mid-East tensions fuelled safe-haven demand for bullion, but its next move depends on this weeks U.S. inflation data, pivotal to determining the Feds upcoming rate trajectory.

      "Gold prices eased on Tuesday after rising nearly 2% in the previous session as investors cautiously turned back to riskier assets and looked forward to further cues on the U.S. central bank's policy stance. Spot gold was down 0.1% at 1,858.64 per ounce as of 1:44 p.m. ET (1744 GMT), after rising to a more than one week high earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures settled 0.6% higher at $1,875.30 an ounce. Spot gold rose 1.6% on Monday, its biggest one-day jump in five months, as military clashes between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas boosted demand for safe-haven investments. Profit-taking and increased investor appetite for risk pressured prices, although the conflict between Israel and Hamas limited gold's losses, said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities. Gold is often a safe haven for investors during times of global instability. Wall Street's main indexes opened higher , though caution prevailed amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. Markets focused on the Federal Reserve's September monetary policy meeting minutes to be published on Wednesday and U.S. Consumer Prices Index (CPI) data due on Thursday. \"If the CPI report comes hotter than expected, especially the core number, it will be negative for gold as it will indicate that the Fed will have to keep rates higher for longer, Melek added. As bullion yields no interest, it tends to lose its attraction when interest rates rise. Top ranking Fed officials indicated on Monday that rising yields on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds could steer the Fed away from further increases in its short-term policy rate. The next level of potential resistance (for gold) is seen around $1,885, followed by $1,900, Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, wrote in a note. Spot silver fell 0.6% to $21.75 per ounce, platinum lost 0.7% to $879.71 and palladium gained 2.5% to $1,168.66. Israel has launched an air strike against Syria's Aleppo Airport late on Saturday that put it out of service, the Syrian defence ministry said.

      "Gold prices scaled a one-week high on Monday after military conflict between Israeli forces and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas raised political unrest in the Middle East, bolstering the safe-haven appeal of the metal. Israels troops were battling on Monday to clear out Hamas gunmen more than two days after they burst across the fence from Gaza on a deadly rampage. Gold is considered a safe store of value amid political and economic turmoil. Spot gold was up 1.1% at $1,853.20 per ounce by 0141 p.m. EDT (1741 GMT), its highest since Sept. 29. U.S. gold futures settled 1% higher at $1,864.30. There are a lot of questions about what could happen next in the Middle East, if the situation further escalates, then gold prices could move towards $1,900, said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. Wall Streets main indexes fell, while crude prices jumped more than 4% as the Middle East violence rattled markets. [.N][O/R] Market focus is also on minutes from the Federal Reserves latest monetary policy meeting and the U.S. inflation data due later this week. We do not believe the FOMC will continue to hike rates into increased uncertainty, and the prospect for peak rates have suddenly moved closer despite the potential inflationary impact of higher oil prices, Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a note. Traders are now pricing in an around 28% chance of another rate hike from the Fed this year, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding bullion. Spot silver gained 1.2% to $21.86 per ounce. Platinum rose 1% to $885.81, while palladium slumped nearly 2% to $1,135.99. Platinum demand from fuel cell vehicles is expected to offset a portion of the demand lost as autocatalyst demand falls, Heraeus analysts wrote in a note. \n",
      "Gold prices rose more than 1% on Monday as the military conflict between Israeli forces and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas raised political uncertainty in the Middle East, prompting safe-haven buying of investments like bullion. Israel pounded the Palestinian enclave of Gaza on Sunday, killing hundreds of people in retaliation for one of the bloodiest attacks in its history when gunmen from Hamas rampaged through Israeli towns on Saturday. Gold is used as a safe investment during times of political and financial uncertainty. Spot gold jumped almost 1% to $1,849.10 per ounce by 1132 GMT, having hit its highest level in a week. U.S. gold futures also climbed 1% to $1,863.40. With investors looking for safe haven assets, gold has benefited at least in the short-term from the spike in geopolitical tensions, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo. The spiralling violence between Israel and Hamas threatens to start a major new war in the Middle East, sending oil prices higher and boosting the demand for safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasuries, the dollar and the Japanese yen along with gold. That said, high US interest rates will remain a headwind for gold. We expect only higher gold prices once the Fed starts to sound more dovish over the course of 2024, added Staunovo. A hot inflation print later in the week could pave the way for another U.S. interest rate hike this year, dulling golds appeal. Investors are also focused on the minutes of the U.S. central banks September meeting due on Wednesday. The key question is how lasting these safe-haven flows are if this weekend has brought some tectonic shifts in the geopolitical landscape. At least from a commodity perspective, geopolitics tends to be a noise element rather than a lasting and impactful fundamental force, Julius Baer analyst Norbert Rcker said in a note. Among other metals, spot silver gained 0.2% to $21.62 per ounce, platinum advanced 0.9% to $884.88 and palladium fell 0.4% to $1,153.91. \n",
      "Gold prices climbed more than 1% on Monday as dramatic clashes between Israeli and Hamas forces over the weekend raised the risk of a wider Middle East conflict and spurred a rush to safe-haven investments like bullion. Israel pounded the Palestinian enclave of Gaza on Sunday, killing hundreds of people in retaliation for one of the bloodiest attacks in its history when Islamist group Hamas rampaged through Israeli towns on Saturday. Spot gold jumped 1% to $1,849.90 per ounce by 0753 GMT, having hit its highest level in a week. U.S. gold futures climbed 1.1% to $1,864.50. Gold has regained its safe-haven status following the geopolitical events over the weekend, City Index Senior Analyst Matt Simpson said. We see the potential for gold to head for $1,880, but unless we see bond yields move materially lower, I doubt it can break $1,900 any time soon. The spiralling violence threatens to start a major new war in the Middle East, sending oil prices higher and boosting the demand for safe-haven assets like Treasuries, the dollar and the Japanese yen along with gold. Gold rebounded sharply from seven-month lows hit on Friday, but its upside remained capped by strong U.S. economic data that has bolstered the view that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to end its monetary policy tightening cycle in the near term. Last week, data showed that U.S. employment increased by the most in eight months in September, pointing to persistent labour market strength. A hot inflation print later in the week could pave the way for another U.S. interest rate hike this year. Higher U.S. rates raise the opportunity cost of holding gold, which yields no interest.

      "The U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority on Wednesday appeared poised to revive a Republican-drawn electoral map in South Carolina that was blocked by a lower court for racial bias after 30,000 Black residents were moved out of a congressional district . During arguments in a case that could help decide control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2024 elections, the conservative justices signaled sympathy toward arguments made by South Carolina officials defending the changes in composition of the district as driven by partisan benefit for Republicans. At issue was a map adopted last year by the Republican-led state legislature that redrew the boundaries of one of South Carolina's seven U.S. House of Representatives districts - one that includes parts of Charleston along the Atlantic coast. A federal three-judge panel in January ruled that the map sorted voters along racial lines and diminished the clout of Black voters in violation of the U.S. Constitution's 14th and 15th Amendments, which guarantee equal protection under the law and prohibit race-based voting discrimination. Black voters tend to favor Democratic candidates. A practice called gerrymandering involves the manipulation of electoral district boundaries to marginalize a certain set of voters and increase the influence of others. In this case, the state legislature was accused of racial gerrymandering to reduce the influence of Black voters in South Carolina's 1st congressional district. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts expressed skepticism that the plaintiffs - Black voters who challenged the map - met their burden in the case, noting that they challenged the it \"without any direct evidence, with no alternative map, with no odd-shape districts which we often get in gerrymandering cases.\" Roberts added, \"Have we ever had a case before where all it is is circumstantial evidence?\" The Republican legislators and other state officials who appealed the lower court's ruling argued that the map was designed to secure partisan advantages, a practice that the Supreme Court in 2019 decided was not reviewable by federal courts - unlike racial gerrymandering, which remains illegal. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wondered whether the challengers had overcome the presumption of good faith courts must give legislatures. \"Here, there's no evidence that the legislature could have achieved its partisan tilt - which everyone says is permissible - in any other way,\" Gorsuch said. The new map increased the district's share of white voters while reducing its share of Black voters, which the lower court referred to as \"bleaching.\" The Republicans faulted those judges for finding that the district's composition was motivated primarily by race rather than Republican interests. Leah Aden, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund who argued on behalf of challengers to the map, said the evidentiary record \"reflects that there was a racial target, it reflects that there was a significant sorting of Black people, it reflects unrebutted expert evidence of race rather than party explaining the assignment of voters.\" The court's liberal justices questioned the arguments made to defend the map. \"Your defense was, 'We didn't look at the racial data for this purpose.' And what the (lower) court said was, 'I don't believe that,'\" liberal Justice Elena Kagan told a lawyer arguing for South Carolina. The eventual ruling by the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, may determine whether Democrats have a realistic shot to win the 1st district, currently represented by Republican Nancy Mace. The map shifted 30,000 Black residents into the neighboring 6th congressional district that stretches 125 miles (200 km) inland from Charleston. These voters were unlawfully \"exiled,\" the three-judge panel wrote. The 6th district has been held for three decades by Democrat Jim Clyburn, one of the most prominent Black members of Congress. Clyburn's is the only one of South Carolina's House districts held by a Democrat. Legislative districts across the United States are redrawn to reflect population changes documented in the nationwide census conducted every decade. With the district's previous boundaries in place, Mace only narrowly defeated an incumbent Democrat in 2020 - by just over 1 percentage point, or 5,400 votes. With the redistricting, Mace won re-election in 2022 by 14 percentage points. The parties in the case have asked the Supreme Court to decide the case by the end of the year to enable the map to be finalized ahead of the Nov. 5, 2024, congressional elections. Similar legal battles over electoral maps in other states could influence which party ends up controlling the House. The Supreme Court in June ruled against Alabama Republicans in one such case, ordering that state to devise a second majority-Black U.S. House district in a ruling that gave a boost to Democrats. Republicans hold a slim 221-212 House margin. \n",
      "Republicans who control the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday nominated Steve Scalise to serve as speaker following last week's ouster of Kevin McCarthy , but delayed further action when he appeared to be short of the support needed to win a vote of the full chamber. Scalise, now No. 2 on the Republican leadership ladder, edged rival Jim Jordan in a secret ballot vote to secure his party's nomination for the top post. Lawmakers had been told to expect a 3 p.m. ET (1900 GMT) vote, but that hour came and went with no action after several of Jordan's backers said they would not support Scalise in a vote on the House floor. Republicans can afford only a handful of defections as they control the chamber by a narrow 221-212 majority and Democrats are not expected to vote for any Republican candidate. \"We're working hard to get unified. We need to get unified because the world is not waiting,\" Scalise, 58, told reporters. \"Obviously we still have work to do.\" Acting Speaker Patrick McHenry told reporters a vote \"could be as early as today.\" \"It's not over yet. That was the inside race. Now the outside race starts,\" said Representative Thomas Massie, who had voted for Jordan. Massie and said he expected to meet privately with Scalise ahead of a floor vote. The tally was 113 for Scalise and 99 for Jordan, lawmakers said. [1/4] U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) speaks as he walks to a candidate forum at the Longworth House office building, after Kevin McCarthy was ousted as Speaker of the House, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 10, 2023. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein Acquire Licensing Rights Jordan plans to vote for Scalise on the floor and is encouraging his colleagues to do the same, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. McCarthy in January had to endure 15 rounds of voting before clinching the speakership. Before selecting Scalise, Republicans rejected a proposal that would have required their nominee to secure 217 of their 221 votes. That allowed Scalise to win the nomination quickly, but left open the question of whether he would face a repeat of the battle in January for the role of speaker, which played out over four days. Republican Representative Kat Cammack predicted the floor vote would be a \"bloodbath ... a continuation of the chaos that has plagued the House.\" Republicans say they need to quickly resolve a leadership vacuum that has prevented the House from addressing the war in Israel , approving more aid to Ukraine and passing spending bills before current government funding runs out on Nov. 17. Scalise said his first action as speaker would be to schedule a vote on a resolution making clear that the United States stands with Israel in its war with Hamas militants in Gaza. It took only eight Republicans to oust McCarthy last week, a fact that could make leading the caucus a challenge for any new speaker. While McCarthy was the first speaker in U.S. history to be removed in a formal vote, the last two Republicans to hold the job wound up leaving under pressure from party hardliners. Americans have little confidence in Congress' ability to overcome its partisan differences - and the Republican infighting that led to McCarthy's ouster on Oct. 3. Some 64% of respondents to a Reuters/Ipsos poll last week said they did not believe Washington politicians could put aside partisan disagreements for the good of the nation. \n",
      "A group of New York state Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives will introduce a motion to expel indicted fellow Republican George Santos from the chamber, two of the members said on Wednesday. The move comes a day after federal prosecutors filed 23 fresh criminal counts against the first-term U.S. representative, accusing him of inflating his campaign's fundraising numbers and charging campaign contributors' credit cards without their consent. Santos, who represents a district including parts of New York City and its eastern suburbs, has been enmeshed in scandal since his November 2022 election, first facing accusations that he fabricated much of his resume and then criminal indictment. But with a narrow 221-212 majority, the House's Republican leadership has not taken action. Santos pleaded not guilty to an initial May indictment and has said he will do the same for the new one. The charges against Santos include false statements, aggravated identity theft and credit card fraud, accusing him of using the credit card information of people who had already donated to his campaign to make additional contributions. \"He has no business being in the halls of the House of Representatives. He's an immoral person, he's an untrustworthy person, he's scammed hundreds of thousands of voters,\" Representative Nick LaLota, a Republican who also represents a New York suburb, told reporters on Wednesday. A motion to expel would require support from two-thirds of members in the House, meaning 290 votes. Democrats have repeatedly called for Santos to be expelled, and over a dozen Republicans have done the same. \"If they want to be judge, jury and arbitrator of the whole goddamn thing, let them do it,\" Santos said on Wednesday. LaLota said the group did not yet have support from the required two-thirds of the House, but predicted the resolution would \"catch fire.\" It is unclear when the motion would get a vote on the House floor, given that Republicans are currently trying to elect a new nominee for speaker after eight Republicans sided with all Democrats to oust Kevin McCarthy in a historic first last week. \n",
      "Gold prices gained on Friday, helped by a technical rebound after a nine-day losing streak, although robust U.S. jobs data raised worries over another U.S. rate hike and kept bullion on track for its second weekly drop. Spot gold was up 0.6% at $1,831.09 per ounce by 1:41 p.m. EDT (1741 GMT) but on track for its second straight weekly loss, down 0.9% so far. U.S. gold futures settled 0.7% higher at $1,845.20 per ounce. Benchmark Treasury yields headed for a weekly increase, denting the appeal of gold. The bounce in gold prices despite the strong jobs data indicates that selling pressure has been exhausted and there is covering of short positions, said Tai Wong, a New York-based independent metals trader. Gold prices fell as much as 0.5% earlier in the session after the U.S. Labor Department's report showed non-farm payrolls increased by 336,000 jobs in September on a monthly basis, beating expectations of 170,000 additions, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Traders are pricing in around a 29% chance of another rate hike from the Fed this year, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding bullion. With the recent rally in bond yields and the dollar, it is difficult to build a bullish case for gold, Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a note. But \"we maintain a patiently bullish view on gold with the timing for a fresh push to the upside being very dependent on U.S. economic data as we wait for the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) to turn its focus from rate hikes to cuts,\" Hansen said. Spot silver gained 3.1% to $21.54 an ounce, platinum rose 2.6% to $876.73 and palladium firmed 1.8% to $1,161.72. All were on track for weekly losses. \n",
      "Gold prices edged lower for a ninth straight session on Thursday, as U.S. data indicating tight labor market conditions raised worries about the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates higher for sometime. Spot gold eased 0.1% to $1,819.98 per ounce by 2:04 p.m. EDT (1804 GMT). U.S. gold futures settled 0.2% lower at $1,831.80 per ounce. The whole narrative of holding rates higher for longer is the big reason why people are removing positions from gold as the opportunity cost of holding it has risen, Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities, said. Since advancing above the key $2,000-per-ounce level in early May, gold prices have fallen nearly 12% as a hawkish rhetoric on rates from the Fed has lifted bond yields to their highest level in 16 years. [US/] The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose moderately last week, while layoffs declined in September, pointing to still-tight labor market conditions. Market focus now shifts to Septembers nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which is expected to show that employers added 170,000 jobs. If the jobs data comes stronger than expected, then market expectation of one more hike will rise, and with that gold prices could dip below $1,800, added Melek. Offering some respite to gold, the dollar index fell for the second straight session, making bullion less expensive for other currency holders. For me to turn decidedly bullish on gold, we now need to see a solid bullish reversal candle on the daily timeframe, and this needs to be backed by further evidence that (Treasury) yields have topped out, Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, wrote in a note. Spot silver lost 0.1% to $20.94 per ounce. Platinum fell 0.8% to $859.72, after hitting its lowest in a year. Palladium slipped 1.8% to fresh five-year lows at $1,146.73. \n",
      "Gold prices held steady on Thursday as Treasury yields pulled back from 16-year highs and investors awaited U.S. jobs data for more clarity on the Federal Reserves interest rate path. Spot gold edged up 0.1% to $1,822.79 per ounce by 1201 GMT. U.S. gold futures gained 0.1% to $1,836.70 per ounce. Gold on Wednesday posted its worst losing run since 2016, dropping for an eighth straight session, as the likelihood of U.S. interest rates staying higher for longer weighed on sentiment. Echoing investor demand, SPDR Gold Trust, the worlds largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell to their lowest since August 2019 on Wednesday. Over the past few weeks gold really took a tumble, the big driver for that appears to be the rise in long-term U.S. interest rates, said Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics. The benchmark 10-year bond yield slipped after data on Wednesday showed U.S. private payrolls increased far less than expected in September. Septembers non-farm payrolls report on Friday is expected to show that employers added 170,000 jobs. Traders are pricing in around a 37% chance of another rate hike from the Fed this year, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates as these increase the opportunity cost of holding it. As we get towards the end of this year, we do think that the price of gold will appreciate next year and in our view that the Fed will cut interest rates by more than markets currently anticipate, Gardner said. Spot silver rose 0.6% to $21.09 per ounce, having slipped to its lowest since mid-March this week. Platinum fell 0.5% to $861.92 after hitting its lowest in a year in the last session. Palladium slipped 1.4% to fresh 5-year lows at $1,151.63. \n",
      "Gold was steady on Thursday, but could end an eight-session losing streak, last seen in 2016, as U.S. bond yields and the dollar retreated from recent highs ahead of a keenly awaited non-farm payrolls report this week. Spot gold was steady at $1,821.64 per ounce by 0733 GMT. U.S. gold futures gained 0.1% to $1,835.80. While there is an attempt for gold prices to stabilize into todays session, there is not much conviction of a reversal just yet, IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong said. Any moves before the U.S. non-farm payroll may be short-lived, with the official jobs data still the key catalyst in dictating market direction along with the U.S. CPI data next week, he added. Data on Thursday showed U.S. private payrolls increased far less than expected in September. Markets now await the Labor Departments more comprehensive employment report on Friday. A broad selloff in world government bonds on Wednesday drove up U.S. 30-year Treasury yields to 5% for the first time since 2007. The benchmark 10-year bond yield fell from 16-year highs on Thursday and the U.S. dollar was 0.1% lower, easing some pressure on non-yielding gold. SPDR Gold Trust, the worlds largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell to its lowest since August 2019. Spot gold may test a resistance at $1,834 per ounce, a break above which could lead to a gain to $1,855, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. The subdued dollar also buoyed other greenback-priced precious metals, with spot silver 0.5% to $21.07 per ounce, having slipped to its lowest since mid-March this week.

The benchmark U.S. 10-year bond yield scaled fresh 16-year highs, making non-yielding assets like gold less attractive.

I even think prices can fall to $1,750 if they manage to break below $1,800, said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. Gold prices briefly ticked up earlier in the session after U.S. private payrolls increased far less than expected in September. Meanwhile, the U.S. services sector slowed in September as new orders fell to a nine-month low, but the pace remained consistent with expectations for solid economic growth in the third quarter. Markets are now pricing in a 24% chance of another 25-basis point rate hike from the Fed this year, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Focus will now be on the key non-farm payrolls report due on Friday for more clarity on Feds rate-hike path. If the jobs report comes softer, then that will give gold ammunition to rally, Haberkorn said. Downside risks are likely to persist as the landing points for golds key drivers remain uncertain. But we recommend those long (on) the metal to hold, as we expect a recovery, UBS said in a note, lowering its year-end gold price forecast by $100 to $1,850. Gold losses came despite a softer dollar. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six peers, was down 0.2%. [USD/] Auto-catalyst metal palladium was down 1.7% at $1,169.40 after hitting its lowest since late 2018 earlier in the session. Spot silver fell 1.2% to $20.90 per ounce, while platinum lost 0.6% to $866.24. \n",
      "Gold edged higher on Wednesday, helped by a pullback in the dollar after softer U.S. jobs data, although higher bond yields and worries that U.S. interest rates will likely remain higher for longer kept bullion near seven-month lows. Spot gold was up 0.2% at $1,825.99 per ounce by 1238 GMT, while U.S. gold futures were steady at $1,841.20. The dollar slipped 0.3%, making gold less expensive for other currency holders. Data on Tuesday showed U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in August, pointing to a still-tight labour market that could lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. However, U.S. private payrolls increased far less than expected in September, data showed on Wednesday, leaving investors waiting for the main non-farm payrolls report on Friday for more clues to the Feds rate hike path. The benchmark U.S. 10-year bond yield scaled fresh 16-year highs, while sentiment in wider financial markets also remained weak as the bond rout continues. The price of gold has fallen more than $100 in the past two weeks as bets for higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates dented the zero-yielding assets appeal and partly overshadowed its traditional safe-haven role. A fall below $1,800 is likely, if the narrative that the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer continues to gain traction, said ActivTrades senior analyst Ricardo Evangelista. Markets are now pricing in a 44% chance of another 25-basis-point rate hike from the Fed this year, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Auto-catalyst metal palladium was down 0.8% at$1,179.66 after hitting its lowest since November 2018 earlier in the session. Palladium has also been caught up in the downward pull... We believe the current price weakness to be excessive and see no fundamental justification for it, Commerzbank said in a note. Spot silver rose 0.4% to $21.22 per ounce, having slipped to its lowest since mid-March on Tuesday, while platinum gained 0.5% to $875.86, after hitting its lowest in a year. \n",
      "Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives face new pressure to select a speaker after Israel declared war on Sunday, following a rare attack by Hamas militants that has prompted calls for more U.S. military aid. Some Republicans, including Representative Jim Jordan, a top candidate for the job, also want lawmakers to agree on how to move forward on the thorniest issue the House faces federal spending for the current year when they choose a new speaker. The U.S. in 2016 pledged $3.8 billion in annual aid to Israel under former President Barack Obama, part of a record 10-year $38 billion aid deal that guarantees weapons, ammo and other military support. House Republicans are expected to hear from speaker candidates behind closed doors on Tuesday and vote to choose their nominee on Wednesday. A House floor vote to elect a replacement for Republican former Speaker Kevin McCarthy could come later in the week. Until then, the chamber cannot approve new aid. \"It's not ideal,\" Republican Representative Michael McCaul told CNN on Sunday. \"What kind of message are we sending to our adversaries when we can't govern, when we're dysfunctional, when we don't even have a speaker of the House?\" Jordan and others also want a spending agreement, which could avert a government shutdown next month. \"When we walk out of that room we've got to have 218 votes for a Republican speaker and we've got to have 218 votes for how we deal with Nov. 17, when the funding bill for the government comes due,\" Jordan, who is battling the House's No.2 Republican Steve Scalise of Louisiana for speakership, told Fox News on Sunday. Hardliners pushing for cuts that would reduce government funding to fiscal 2022 levels have divided House Republicans for months and brought Congress to the brink of a government shutdown just over a week ago. Any House bill that includes severe spending cuts is unlikely to pass the Democrat-controlled Senate. \"I am not going to support anybody until the conference figures out spending,\" Republican Representative Ken Buck told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday. Securing the 218 votes to elect a new speaker behind closed doors would avoid a recurrence of the 15 floor votes that preceded McCarthy's election to the speakership in January. Matt Gaetz, the Florida congressman who led McCarthys ouster, downplayed the speaker election's impact on Israel's security needs, suggesting on NBCs \"Meet the Press\" that the U.S. could fulfill the country's requests. U.S. President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday that \"additional assistance for the Israeli Defense Forces is now on its way to Israel,\" and that more would follow in the coming days, the White House said. \"The actions taken by some members of my party were wholly irresponsible without this going on,\" Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie told ABC's \"This Week\". \"They're now even putting a brighter light on the irresponsibility of not having someone in place.\" \n",
      "New York Mayor Eric Adams this weekend visits the Darien Gap, a treacherous rainforest traversed by thousands of mostly South American migrants a month, to try to dissuade them from coming as U.S. cities like his own struggle to accommodate them. His unusual trip to Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia underscores the criticism that he and other Democratic city and state leaders have voiced for the immigration policies of their fellow Democrat, President Joe Biden. \"Our hearts are endless, but our resources are not,\" Adams said at a press conference during a stop in Puebla in central Mexico. \"They deserve a more dignified environment than we are able to give.\" That New York City's mayor has traveled thousands of miles to make his case highlights how the latest wave of migrants is reshaping the immigration debate among some Democratic leaders. Republican governors near the border have been fiercely critical of Biden's border policies. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has been busing thousands of migrants north to New York, Chicago and other Democratic-controlled cities. But in recent months, Adams and some other Democrats have said their cities far from the southern border are now also being strained by a surge of new arrivals, many of whom are fleeing violence and economic distress in Venezuela. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, called the influx \"untenable\" in a letter to Biden on Monday, while the mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, also a Democrat, said this week he planned to visit the U.S.-Mexico border after more than 17,000 migrants had arrived in the city since last year. Immigration will likely be a campaign theme in the U.S. 2024 presidential race with a 54% majority of Americans agreeing with the statement that \"immigration is making life harder for native-born Americans,\" a September Reuters/Ipsos poll found. Some 73% of Republicans and 37% of Democrats surveyed agreed with that statement. [1/2] New York City Mayor Eric Adams delivers a speech during a meeting with migrants, community leaders, and mayors from the Mixteca region, in Puebla, Mexico October 5, 2023. REUTERS/Imelda Medina/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights Biden's administration said on Thursday it will add sections to a wall to reduce the record number of migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, carrying forward a signature policy of former President Donald Trump, Biden's predecessor and the frontrunner in the Republican race to challenge him in 2024. Adams has said that many asylum seekers set out for New York in the belief they would receive jobs and rooms in \"five-star hotels\" upon arrival, led astray by misinformation spread by smugglers and on social media. \"We're saying that is not true.\" The New York Immigration Coalition and other advocacy groups have criticized Adams' trip as an ineffectual use of time and money when Adams is slashing city budgets, saying New York's mayor has no influence on international policy and that the city has mismanaged the existing shelter system. They have said his remarks last month that the migrant crisis will \"destroy New York City\" are inflammatory. This week, Adams' office asked a judge to end a decades-old right-to-shelter mandate, which requires New York to provide a place to sleep to anyone who needs one. The city says hundreds of migrants are arriving each day with nowhere to stay. The effort is opposed by the Legal Aid Society, which advocates for newly arrived migrants seeking shelter. Joshua Goldfein, a Legal Aid attorney, said it was unclear whether physically traveling to the Darien Gap might help with the crisis in New York City, and there was more the mayor could be doing without leaving his hometown. Much of the misinformation the mayor has described was being seen by asylum seekers on cellphones, in TikTok videos being shared on WhatsApp. To counter this, the city should be making its own videos in the languages of the migrants traveling north, Goldfein said. \"All three levels of government need to step up here to solve this problem,\" Goldfein said: the federal government should be giving people work authorization, and assisting local officials in states and cities to meet new arrivals and help them resettle in less expensive and strained cities. \"But they're all sort of pointing fingers at each other.\" Adams will tour migrant shelters in Ecuador on Friday, and on Saturday he will visit the Darien Gap, a roadless jungle region straddling the Colombia-Panama border that requires several days of dangerous hiking to cross, although it is unclear how far in the mayor will go. \n",
      "California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday vetoed a bill passed recently by the state legislature to explicitly ban caste discrimination, citing existing laws that already prohibit ancestry discrimination, which made the bill \"unnecessary.\" Had Newsom signed the bill, officially called Senate Bill 403 or SB 403, California would have become the first ever U.S. state to explicitly ban caste discrimination. Newsom's veto is a big setback for activists who had been advocating for the legislation. U.S. discrimination laws ban ancestry discrimination though they do not explicitly mention a prohibition on casteism. California's legislation targeted the caste system in South Asian and Hindu immigrant communities by adding caste as a protected class to the state's existing anti-discrimination laws. The bill was introduced and authored by Democratic state Senator Aisha Wahab , an Afghan American, in March. An earlier version of it passed the state Senate before undergoing revisions. The revised version, which listed caste under \"ancestry\" and not as a separate category, was passed by California's state Assembly in late August and by the state Senate in early September with a near unanimous vote. The bill defined caste as \"an individual's perceived position in a system of social stratification on the basis of inherited status.\" \"Because discrimination based on caste is already prohibited under these existing categories, this bill is unnecessary,\" Newsom said in a letter to California state lawmakers posted on the website of the governor's office. \"For this reason, I cannot sign this bill.\" Activists opposing caste discrimination said it is no different from other forms of discrimination like racism and hence should be outlawed. Opponents of the bill in California said that since U.S. laws already ban ancestry discrimination, a legislation of this type becomes meaningless and only serves to stigmatize the entire community, mostly Hindus and South Asians, with a broad brush. Prior to Newsom's veto, the movement to fight caste discrimination in North America had picked up energy in recent months. Earlier this year, Seattle became the first U.S. city to outlaw caste discrimination after a city council vote and Toronto's school board became the first in Canada to recognize that caste discrimination existed in the city's schools. In California itself, last month, Fresno became only the second U.S. city to ban caste discrimination after a unanimous city council vote. The issue is particularly important to Americans of Indian descent and Hindus. As more Indians and South Asians have moved to the U.S., particularly to California and Silicon Valley, some of America's biggest technology companies have also had to confront the issue of caste discrimination. Many U.S. tech firms are also headed by leaders of Indian origin such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O) CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft (MSFT.O) CEO Satya Nadella and IBM (IBM.N) CEO Arvind Krishna. The caste system is among the world's oldest forms of rigid social stratification. It dates back thousands of years and allows many privileges to upper castes but represses lower castes. The Dalit community is on the lowest rung of the Hindu caste system; members have been treated as \"untouchables.\" India outlawed caste discrimination over 70 years ago, yet several studies in recent years show that bias persists. One study found people from lower castes were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs. Dalits still face widespread abuse across India, where their attempts at upward social mobility have at times been violently put down. Debate over the caste system in India and abroad is contentious and intertwined with religion. Some people say discrimination is now rare, especially outside India. Indian government policies reserving seats for lower-caste students at top Indian universities have helped many land tech jobs in the West in recent years.

      "Gold prices headed back towards seven-month lows on Wednesday as the ascending dollar and bond yields after strong U.S. jobs data kept markets expectant of further monetary policy tightening, while palladium slipped to its weakest level since late 2018. Spot gold eased 0.2% to $1,819 per ounce by 0723 GMT, while U.S. gold futures dropped 0.3% to $1,835.50. Prices fell for a seventh consecutive session on Tuesday to touch their lowest level since March at $1,813.90, as the U.S. dollar strengthened on data showing U.S. job openings unexpectedly increased in August. The continuous selloff in U.S. Treasuries is keeping gold under pressure but since most of the moves have been priced in, there should not be any further corrections in bullion prices, said Kunal Shah, head of research at Nirmal Bang Commodities in Mumbai. We are at the end of the (Fed) rate hike cycle with another 25 bps likely and I think it will be over then. The last legs are very painful and that is what we are witnessing now. The benchmark U.S. 10-year bond yield scaled fresh 16-year highs, diminishing demand for non-interest-paying bullion. Fed officials consider the rising long-term Treasury yields as evidence their tight-money policies are working. The elevated dollar also pressured other greenback-priced precious metals, with spot silver down 0.6% at $21.03 per ounce, having slipped to its lowest since mid-March in the previous session. Platinum slid 0.9% to $863.48, its lowest in a year. Palladium dropped 2.2% to $1,163.55 and hit its lowest since November 2018. This is a broad-based impact coming from the rapid rise in rates, said Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery. The interpretation within the more industrially led metals relates to concerns that higher rates will damage demand. \n",

      "Gold prices languished near a seven-month low on Tuesday, weighed down by a robust dollar and elevated bond yields as the likelihood of U.S. interest rates staying higher for longer dominated sentiment. Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,825.09 per ounce at 1:49 p.m. EDT (1749 GMT), after hitting its lowest level since early March. U.S. gold futures settled 0.3% lower at $1,841.50 per ounce. U.S. job openings unexpectedly increased in August, pointing to tight labour market conditions that could compel the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. \"The JOLTS report has surprised the market as it raises prospects of another hike but also lowers expectation of a slowdown in the U.S. economy, pressuring precious metals,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Gold is considered a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties. But higher interest rates raise the opportunity cost of holding bullion, which is priced in dollars and does not yield interest. Gold prices briefly ticked up earlier in the session as the dollar sharply weakened against the yen, just moments after briefly rising above 150 for the first time since October 2022, signalling a possible intervention by the Bank of Japan. \"If the Bank of Japan intervenes, it could weaken dollar in the short term and provide some support to the precious metals,\" Moya added. The market focus is now on September nonfarm payrolls data due on Friday. \"We reiterate our 12-month target of $1,725 per ounce and remain cautious on gold,\" said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke. Spot silver rose 0.6% to $21.20 per ounce. Platinum fell 0.7% to $871.40. Palladium, primarily used by automakers, slipped 1.5% to $1,183.20, its lowest since late 2018. \"Palladium looks structurally challenged because demand is geared towards cars with an internal combustion engine,\" BofA wrote in a note dated Oct. 2. \"Palladium may be the first casualty of the energy transition.\" Israel has launched an air strike against Syria's Aleppo Airport late on Saturday that put it out of service, the Syrian defence ministry said.

      "Gold extended its decline for a sixth straight session on Monday to hit a near seven-month trough, as a robust dollar and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates took the shine off bullion. Spot gold was down 0.9% by 1:52 p.m. EDT (1752 GMT) at $1,831.70 per ounce, its lowest level since early March. U.S. gold futures settled 1% lower at $1,847.20. \"There is a reckoning that interest rates are going to be higher for much longer, which has been the bearish element in the precious market. Gold prices could go below $1,800 in the near term,\" said Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco Metals. \"Trends in the currency markets tend to be stronger and longer-lasting. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar may not end anytime soon, pressuring the gold market.\" The U.S. dollar (.DXY) rose 0.6%, making bullion less attractive to other currency holders. Traders are pricing in a 55% chance that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates at the current range of 5.25%-5.50% this year, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Federal Governor Michelle Bowman said she remains willing to support another increase in rates if incoming data shows progress on inflation is stalling or proceeding too slowly. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, however, said rates are \"at or near\" sufficiently restrictive level. Since powering above the key $2,000-per-ounce level in early May, gold prices have fallen more than 11%, or $230, pressured by a sharp rise in benchmark U.S. Treasury yields, which makes the non-yielding gold less attractive. \"The buying on dips (in gold) by central banks is now conspicuously absent,\" said Tai Wong, a New York-based independent metals trader. The market focus now shifts to job openings data, private hiring numbers and U.S. nonfarm payrolls over the course of the week. Spot silver slid 4.2% to a more than six-month low of $21.23 per ounce. Platinum fell 2.8% to $879.42 and palladium dipped 3.1% to $1,207.51. \n",
      "A federal court on Thursday ordered Alabama to implement a new congressional map that will likely give Democrats an additional seat in next year's elections, when control of the closely divided U.S. House of Representatives is up for grabs. The three-judge panel selected a map that preserves the state's lone majority-Black district while creating a second district in which Black voters make up nearly half of the voting-age population. The decision came after the court found - for the second time - that congressional lines drawn by the Republican-dominated state legislature likely violated the Voting Rights Act by illegally diluting Black votes. Democrats would need to flip five seats in the 435-seat House of Representatives to take back the majority in the November 2024 election. More than a quarter of Alabama's residents are Black, but the Republican-backed plans only included a single district in which Black voters made up a majority or close to it. That district, the 7th, is represented by the state's lone Democrat, Terri Sewell, a Black woman. Civil rights groups challenged the Republican map, arguing that Republicans had deliberately spread Black voters thin to ensure they would continue to win six of the state's seven districts. The U.S. Supreme Court twice declined to overturn the panel's conclusions that the Republican plans were unlawful. \"It did not have to be this way,\" the panel wrote in its decision on Thursday. \"And it would not have been this way if the legislature had created a second opportunity district or majority-minority district.\" Similar challenges are also pending in Louisiana and Georgia, where civil rights groups have argued that Republican lawmakers illegally disadvantaged Black voters by manipulating congressional lines. The new Alabama map was one of three that a court-appointed special master drew for its consideration. The panel included two judges appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump. The third was appointed by Republican former President Ronald Reagan and then elevated to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by Democratic former President Bill Clinton. \n",
      "The former campaign treasurer for U.S. Representative George Santos, who has been indicted on fraud charges, pleaded guilty on Thursday to a conspiracy charge for inflating his 2022 congressional campaign's fundraising numbers. Nancy Marks was arrested on Thursday and entered the plea in federal court in Long Island before U.S. District Judge Joanna Seybert, court records showed. It was not immediately clear if Marks was cooperating with prosecutors. Her lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Santos, a Republican representing parts of Queens and Long Island, was charged in March with defrauding prospective political supporters by laundering funds to pay for his personal expenses and illegally receiving unemployment benefits while he was employed. The 35-year-old political newcomer has pleaded not guilty and resisted calls to resign for lying about his resume. He is free on $500,000 bail. Marks told the Federal Election Commission in a Jan. 31 filing that she had resigned as Santos' campaign treasurer. \n",
      "Lawyers for My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell sought permission on Thursday to quit representing him in defamation lawsuits brought by Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic USA, alleging he owes the attorneys \"millions of dollars\" in unpaid legal fees. Lindell, a prominent supporter of Republican former president and current GOP candidate Donald Trump, is fighting claims that he spread false conspiracy theories that Dominion and Smartmatic voting machines were used to rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election for Democrat Joe Biden. Lindell has not made any payments on his legal bills since July, his lawyers at Parker Daniels Kibort and Lewin & Lewin told federal judges in Minnesota and Washington, D.C. overseeing the defamation cases. Forcing the firm to continue representing Lindell without payment \"could threaten the very existence of the firm,\" Parker Daniels Kibort co-founder Andrew Parker said in a court filing. Parker did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lindell said on Thursday that he is \"out of money\" and praised his lawyers as being courageous. Lindell said he was the victim of \"lawfare\" and that he is unable to borrow money. He said he is looking for new counsel. \"Well find someone, thats the way it is,\" Lindell said. Dominion is seeking $1.3 billion in damages from Lindell and his pillow company in the Washington case. Smartmatic is seeking an unspecified amount of damages in Minnesota federal court. Fox Corp and Fox News in April settled defamation claims brought by Dominion for $787.5 million. Smartmatic's separate $2.7 billion lawsuit against Fox is pending in New York state court. Both companies are also pursuing election-related defamation lawsuits against former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others. Trump has continued to make false claims that voting fraud cost him the last election even as he faces criminal prosecutions in Washington and Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 results. \n",
      "Gold prices extended declines on Friday and were on track for monthly and quarterly declines on expectations that the U.S. central bank may keep interest rates higher for longer.

Bullion is set to end September down 4.6% and the quarter 3.6% lower, after the Federal Reserve struck a hawkish stance. Golds outlook, fortunately or unfortunately, has a lot to do with the underlying interest rate environment moving forward, said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.
